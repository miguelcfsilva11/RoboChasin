RoboChasin is a little game where bloodthirsty robots follow you around in rather peculiar mazes. This game started as a console-based program developed by me and my friend [Emanuel Gestosa](https://github.com/emanuelgestosa). After its completion, I decided that it was time for a little upgrade. To do so, I learned how to use the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library in my free time and developed a graphical interface to go along with the gameplay.
