# RoboChasin
RoboChasin is a little game where bloodthirsty robots follow you around in rather peculiar mazes. This game started as a console-based program developed by me and my friend Emanuel Gestosa. After its completion, I decided that it was time for a little upgrade. To do so, I learned how to use the SDL[https://www.libsdl.org/] library in my free time and developed a graphical interface to go along with the gameplay. The game will be available on itch.io[https://itch.io/] where you'll find lots of intriguing levels to put yourself to the test.
